                Hello, my name is Jaylen Lie and I am a game designer based in Toronto, Canada. I am currently pursuing a degree in Digital Media - Game Arts
                at York University. For a long time I have been passionate about video games, my first introduction to them was through Mario Kart 64 on the 
                Nintendo 64. From there my passion for them has grown, to the point where I want to make games that bring joyful experiences to others, as they 
                have for me.
